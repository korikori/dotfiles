# dotfiles

Use `gnu stow` to add the appropriate symlinks for each project, for example `stow openbox` will create the necessary directory structure (.config/openbox) and then links to the configuration files. A timeless primer on this process that goes into much more detail is available [here](https://alexpearce.me/2016/02/managing-dotfiles-with-stow/).
